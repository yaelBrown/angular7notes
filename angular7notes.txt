Angular 7 tutorial notes. 
  angular uses webpack. 
  Hot model reloading - When webpack refreshes your browser

  cohesion - things that are related should goto together. Be apart of one unit. 
  class - groups of variables (properties) and functions (methods) that are highly related

  angular was introduced in 2010
  angular js (1.x) first version of angular
  angular 2 was angular but rewritten in typescripts
    typescript is easier to work with
    cleaner
  angular 4 came out after angular 2.3
    was not a new framework
    was not a major upgrade
    the addition of angular/router (3.3.0) library pushed angular to angular 4. 
    core, compiler, http were on version 2.3.0
  angular 4 not a major upgrade to angular 2

  typescript - is not javascript, basically a superset of javascript
    has concept of strong or static typing
    has OO features
    catches compile-time errors
    good tooling
    You compile/transpile typescript code to javascript code
    all javascript code is valid typescript code

install typescript
  sudo npm install -g typescript

  tsc --version                     // gives you version of typescript

install node

install angular-cli thru node
  npm install -g @angular/cli       // installs globally

  ng --version                      // shows version of angular-cli installed



Make sure git is installed
  sudo apt-get install git

Create new angular project
  ng new appName
  
  [no angular routing]

  ng serve                           // Starts development environment and runs a server. Similar to live-server



Explore the project
  e2e - end to end task. Tests that simulate a real user
  node_modules - dont deploy to server
  src - Where your source code to application goes
    at least 1 module and 1 component
  assest - where you store static assests like images
  environment - where your store configuration settings for different environments
  main.ts - starting point for application
  karma - test runner for javascript code
  tsconfig - typescript compiler. Converts typescript to javascript

  goto src/app/app.component.ts
    change L9 title to name of app
